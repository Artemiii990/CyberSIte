<!-- Market Analysis -->
<section id="market" class="max-w-5xl mx-auto py-12 px-6">
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-400 mb-6">📊 Market Analysis</h3>
    <div class="bg-gray-800 rounded-2xl shadow-md p-6 space-y-4">
        <p>
            The gaming accessories market is rapidly growing due to the popularity
            of e-sports and streaming culture. Gamers are constantly looking for
            high-performance gear that improves both comfort and performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Competitors such as Amazon, Alza, and Datart dominate the general
            electronics sector, while brands like Razer and Logitech control
            premium peripherals. CyberShop will differentiate itself by focusing
            entirely on gamers, offering curated products and exclusive bundles.
        </p>
        <p>
            The opportunity lies in specialization: a targeted marketplace that
            delivers not only products, but also gaming-related content, trust,
            and community interaction.

<!-- Finance -->
<section id="finance" class="max-w-5xl mx-auto py-12 px-6">
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-400 mb-6">💰 Finance</h3>
    <div class="bg-gray-800 rounded-2xl shadow-md p-6 space-y-4">
        <p>
            Initial costs will include website development, marketing campaigns,
            product sourcing, and logistics setup. Additional expenses include
            warehousing and customer service operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Revenue will come from direct product sales, with an expected margin
            of 15–30%. By offering bundles and exclusive items, CyberShop can
            achieve higher profitability.
        </p>
        <p>
            The break-even point is projected within 12–18 months, depending on
